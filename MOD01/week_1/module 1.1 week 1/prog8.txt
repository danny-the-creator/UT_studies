b904		; out 4,r16 We write r16 to the Data Direction Register:
		; it makes the pin to which the LED is connected act as an
		; output pin. This needs to be done only once: the pin
		; remains an output as long as the program is running.
e000
b905 		; out 5,r16 Write that same 0010 0000 to the PORTB output register;
		; thus the pin is really set to 1 now (5 volts), making
		; the LED light up.
